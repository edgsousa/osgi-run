* 1.6.0 - 2017-October-22

- #66 allow specifying bundle start level in Equinox (thanks to @pnidl) and Felix.
- Upgraded versions of Felix, Gogo and Knopflerfish.
- `runOsgi.bundles` property now includes transitive dependencies by default.
- `runOsgi.bundles` property now accepts Map with config to specify `transitive`, `exclusions` and `startLevel`.
- changed default bundles to include OSGiaaS-CLI instead of Gogo shell.

* 1.5.5 - 2017-July-31

- #62 fixed several issues related to OSGi versions being too strict, causing errors with non-OSGi systemLibs
  and wrapped jars.
- Updated Gradle version used for testing to 3.4.1.

* 1.5.4 - 2017-January-06

- Fixed regression from previous release - systemLibs stopped working due to missing extra packages in config.
- #59 allow local jars to be used as OSGi bundles

* 1.5.3 - 2017-January-03

- #52 fixed issue with task `runOsgi` not being runnable more than once without `clean`.
- #57 added new `createBundlesDir` task. This task's code was simply extracted from the `createOsgiRuntime` task
  (which depends on it now).
- improved naming of internal task classes.

* 1.5.2 - 2016-September-27

- stopped trying to use Specification-[Title, Version] when wrapping jars as that information is rarely useful.
- add version to every package exported by wrapped jars.
- #38 and #49 upgraded Equinox to latest version (3.10.100) and added Gogo bundles to default Equinox environment as the
  Equinox console was deprecated.
- #50 improved plugin structure to make it more standardized. As a consequence, Gradle 3.0 is now supported.
- better logging of task inputs and outputs.
- #48 project's buildDir is now correctly used to create the OSGi environment.
- #53 allow more than one jar to be wrapped using the same configuration.

* 1.5.1 - 2016-July-26

- better algorithm to figure out version number of wrapped jars and system libraries.
- #45 system libraries must export versioned packages.
- add OSGi dependencies to build dynamic configurations earlier so "gradle dependencies" shows OSGi runtime.

* 1.5.0 - 2016-June-03

- #41 sh file should use bash shebang, not sh.
- #43 automatically remove new-lines from javaArgs.
- Added system libs feature to allow running OSGi in mixed mode (system libs run in a regular Java classpath).
- Reformulated the OSGi environment structure and the shell scripts to make them more robust
  and enable the system libs feature.
- Improved the runOsgi task so that it performs exactly the same procedure as the shell scripts.

* 1.4.3 - 2016-April-07

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: stopped applying the 'osgi' plugin automatically.
  This allows other (more complete) OSGi plugins to be used instead with 'osgi-run'.
- Fixed #27 do not kill OSGi runtime during build when the console is unavailable.
- Made excludedBundles default to ['org\\.osgi\\..*']. OSGi API bundles should not be included in the runtime.
- Created 'cleanOsgiRuntime' task. Made 'clean' task depend on it to make the build flow easy.

* 1.4.2 - 2016-March-06

- this release just fixes the 1.4.1 release which failed due to invalid version declaration
- published osgi-run to Maven Central as well as Gradle Plugin Repository and Bintray

* 1.4.1 - 2016-March-06

- Fixed bug where subprojects could not be assigned to bundles
- Added 'copyManifestTo' config option to facilitate OSGi IDE support
- Modified run scripts to allow running from any working directory
- Added excludedBundles option to allow removal of bundles from the runtime at the last possible time
- Fixed #24: do not try to wrap jar without manifest entry as Bnd will throw a NPE

* 1.4.0 - 2016-January-24

- Updated Bnd Lib version to 3.1.0
- Updated Apache Felix version 5.4.0
- Updated Apache Felix bundlerepository version to 2.0.6
- Updated gogo bundles versions
- Updated IPojo version to 1.12.1

* 1.3.1 - 2015-November-22

- #17 added support for Declarative Services
- fixed #19 wrapped bundle MANIFEST instructions were resolving to Object[].toString()

* 1.3.0 - 2015-October-18

This is the first version that is available in Gradle's Plugin Repository!

- automatically wrap non-bundles dependencies and add them to the OSGi runtime
- allow customizing non-bundle wrapping with instructions for Bnd
- createOsgiRuntime task supports incremental build - only runs if needed
- Added support to for Knopflerfish
- Fixed issue with javaArgs not being passed to the java process but to the program
- Added programArgs to allow passing arguments to the Java application (old javaArgs behaviour)
- Improved how the main-class from osgiMain's jar gets found (not case-sensitive, as some jars use different casing)
- Removed Mac command script as the sh command is more appropriate

* 1.2.1 - 2015-July-25

- fixed #11 - do not tell Equinox to start fragment bundles
- Added new example of how to use fragment bundles (running on Equinox)
- Improved existing build-with-subprojects example, fixing #12

* 1.2 - 2015-June-10

This release makes paths to files relative so that the whole OSGi environment
may be moved to a new location and still run just fine.

- made paths in equinox config file relative
- javaArgs included in OS-specific scripts
- made path to runnable jar relative to OS-specific scripts
- better handling of JAVA_HOME in OS-specific scripts

* 1.1 - 2014-Dec-09

- First stable release
